# Anything that comes inside a double quote or triple quotes becomes a string
str1 = "Hello , This is a string"


# Membership Operator
# print("P" in "Prince")
# it checks whether the String Given Is Present in the string OR not , it returns TRUE if it's found
# print("X" not in "Prince")
# it checks whether the String Given Is Not Present, it returns TRUE if it's NOT found

# String Slicing
print(str1[0:5])
# it starts with 0 and ends at 4 !
# it's a rule , like any number given to end , it will end one number before , ex. - [0:10] , it will end at 9 only
